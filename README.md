# Runeword-helper for Diablo II LoD & Diablo II: Resurrected
https://victorhugo183.github.io/runeword-helper/

An application to help you visualize what Runewords you can make with the current Runes you own in Diablo 2.

## Development Notes

This is a React.js project, which uses a Class Component to handle state and passes state down to Functional Child Components.

Runeword-helper uses localStorage to maintain selected runes and display mode preference. if the user clears "Cookie & other site related data" manually in their browser, the user state will be reset.

The data is static and saved locally, I'll do my best to keep it updated with the latest D2R patch.
